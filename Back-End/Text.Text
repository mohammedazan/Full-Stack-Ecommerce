Each of these migration files corresponds to a specific task related to structuring and organizing the database for various aspects of the application.




/////
Why were the tables not directly linked in the original example?
In the original example, foreign keys were not used to directly link the tables. There are several possible reasons for this:

No need for referential integrity: Sometimes, there may not be a dire need to enforce referential integrity through database rules, and developers may prefer to enforce it through the application level (Laravel) using programming logic.

Simplify initial migrations: Some developers may prefer to start with a simpler table design, and then add foreign keys later after ensuring that the table structure is stable.

Modification flexibility: In some cases, developers may want to maintain the flexibility to modify the structure of tables and the relationships between them without being subject to the restrictions that foreign keys may impose.

Performance issues: Some developers may avoid using foreign keys to improve performance on very large databases, as foreign keys can impact the speed of operations (such as delete or update).
